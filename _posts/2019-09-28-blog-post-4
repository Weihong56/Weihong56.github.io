• Printed out molds using a 3D printer with G-code modification for manufacturing specimens 
• Conducted fatigue tests on epoxy and multiaxial fatigue tests on composite materials with a central crack
• Implemented a parameter study using DOE to determine the configuration of specimen to avoid buckling under compression and safe time cost by 60%

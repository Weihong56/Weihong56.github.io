**Description:** <br/>
    Composite materials have been widely used in various industries suzh as automotive, aerospace, etc. Such materials could suffer serious repreated compressive and shear loads which cause the fatigue fracture. Therefore, it is important to research the   


**Contribution:** <br/>
• Conducted multiaxial fatigue tests on composite materials with a central crack <br/>
• Implemented a parameter study using DOE to determine the configuration of specimen to avoid buckling under compression and safe time cost by 75% <br/>


When a specimen is loaded in compression, it could experience instable failure especiallly buckling. it buckles in different modes, and the one requires the lowest critical load is the main concern. To prevent the specimen from buckling during fatigue testing, I have run simulations in Abaqus to decide the configuration of specimen. With the use of DOE, I have saved time comsumption to find the best compromise among several controlable facctors that can affect the critical load.

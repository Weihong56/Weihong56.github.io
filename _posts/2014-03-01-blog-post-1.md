**Description:** <br/>
    Since different groups of cells have corresponding medications reactions, the medical investigation can be greatly facilitated by subculturing cells in certain patterns. <br/>
    
In addition, hydrogel has 3-D space which provides cells an enviroment close to real condition. To incubate cells in the photo-crosslinking hydrogel with desired pattern, it's necessary to create a mask in certain shape which could be costly. As a result, it is beneficial to develop an in-lab skill to maufacture an affordable mask in a desired pattern.<br/>     

**Contribution:** <br/>
* Simplified mask with aluminum foil cut by small plotter 
* Created specific pattern of hydrogel containing 3T3 cells with self-made mask 
* Subcultured cells, including cell thawing and cell freezing 
* Prepared medium and PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline) solution for cell subculture 
* Conducted cytometry and dye-exclusion test for cell viability 
* Formulated photo-crosslinking and bio-compatible hydrogel solution to incubate cells 

*Mask made of aluminum foil <br/>

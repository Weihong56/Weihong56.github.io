Description:

Athelets frequently jump highly and squat quickly. This can cause a severe injury on knees or legs. As a result, it is necessary to provide a solution to minimize the risk of getting injury especially for professional atheletes. By treating the system of knees and legs as a series of mechanical linkages, I calculated the stress distribution and energy absorption when landing from a jump. Accordingly, the prothesis has been designed to dissipate energy and to release the stress on knees.

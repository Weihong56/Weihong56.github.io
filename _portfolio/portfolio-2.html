Addressing Current Biofeedback Treatment for Voiding Dysfunction

<h4>Summary </h4>	
Urinary incontinence, defined as the inability to control urination, affects 20 million people in the US each year resulting in $12.4 billion annual direct costs. It affects 10% of children, 13% of men, and 51% of women. As the impetus for this project was brought forth by providers from Seattle Childrenâ€™s Hospital, children are our primary population. Children face many other issues that accompany urinary incontinence, such as urinary tract infections, nutritional issues, embarrassment, social isolation, and low self-esteem. In addition, children who have urinary incontinence often develop psychological problems as an adult, including depression and anxiety. Biofeedback helps children visualize their muscles using electrical sensors and video games, and has consistently shown an 80% improvement rate in the clinic. However, there are still hurdles with current clinical biofeedback, including intimidation of electrical sensors, time, cost, and psychosocial barriers that keep children from trying biofeedback and even visiting the clinic. Our team is working to bring biofeedback into the home through a mobile gaming app, to increase the motivation and comfort that the patient age 7+ experiences by utilizing rewarding games and comfortable sensors (non-invasive). Additionally, we plan to incorporate in-application provider-patient communication to further reduce the time needed traveling to and in the clinic, and speed-up provider feedback in order to decrease total treatment duration.<br/>

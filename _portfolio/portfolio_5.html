Description:

The structure analysis was performed using ANSYS in order to determine whether the completed SOC-i CubeSat assembly would be able to survive the vibration and acceleration environment during launching.

<h4>Comparision Between Two Structure Design</h4>
Two structures are considered to achieve a better design. 1) one with a nid-rack; 2) one without a mid-rack   <br/>

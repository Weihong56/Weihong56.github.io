•	Simplified mask with aluminum foil cut by small plotter.  
•	Created specific pattern of hydrogel containing 3T3 cells with self-made mask.   
•	Subcultured cells, including cell thawing and cell freezing.  
•	Conducted cytometry and dye-exclusion test for cell viability.  
•	Formulated photo-crosslinking and bio-compatible hydrogel solution to incubate cells.
